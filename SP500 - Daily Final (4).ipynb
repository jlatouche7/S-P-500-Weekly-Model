    "In my exploratory data analysis I fit several models based on weekly S&P 500 Data, I found that all of my models struggled to achieve any actual predictive power. My theory is that weekly data is effective for the normal week to week movements of the index, but I believe it struggles to capture the whole picture of the big movements. In 1 week the market can drastically change and a model only containing weekly data would really struggle to understand these movements. This inspired me to compile a dataset of daily data from the S&P 500 over the last 10 years that will hopefully allow me to capture the full picture of the data. My goal is to build a series of models and find one with ACTUAL predictive power, that can aid small companies in making and maintaing conviction in their financial decisions."

    "Using Root Mean Squared Error will allow us to compare our predicted log returns with actual log returns. While there is some margin for error, generally log returns can be read like simple returns. For example, a 5% increase in simple returns would equal a .05 log return. While this is inexact, it generally is a very good approximation, so going forward this is how I will prepare the units."

    "This standard linear regression gave us an RMSE of .0127, which is much better than how it performed on the weekly data. This shows that our linear regression model on average can predict the following day's change within about 1.27%. For actual financial use this would be quite an ineffective model. This is happening because the linear regression is not meant to handle sequential data like this. When you think about how quickly financial changes can happen like during COVID and in 2008, it makes sense that the model can't predict forward multiple years of how the S&P 500 is going to move."

    "Out of the 3 models, the ARIMA was the most succesful, but the SARIMAX I found to be the most practical for day to day use. While the ARIMA produced the best RMSE on the test set, the further out the predictions got, the less variance there was between guesses and eventually it was predicting the same thing over and over again. This shows me that at a certain point it just made the most sense to use a value of about 0.000389 everyday to be the most accurate. But when it comes to actually predicting for a day to day use this is not effective. I think this could be an effective tool to use though over a longer period of time to estimate where we will be a few weeks/months from now. Log returns are additive, so I think this could be a decent tool to predict perhaps a month ahead. "

    "The SARIMAX, produced a higher RMSE of about .0107, this means that on average it's prediction would be about 1% off. 1% is huge when it comes to financial markets, so this is not a great way to predict the following days price, but it does beat the \"naive\" approaches I mentioned off.\n",
    "    Example: So essentially this means if you were wanting to predict the following day's S&P 500 return, it would be superior to using the 'naive', random walk. So if you are planning on using a naive approach to deciding how an investment will move the following day, trust the model instead, it will give you a better chance at correctly predicting movements. But this would not be a great tool to use for serious financial use."
