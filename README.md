S&P 500 Weekly Movements Final Report

Question: How can small companies leverage and effectively invest their extra resources so they can become a more profitable company or scale up in size?

Problem: The S&P 500 is often used to gauge general market trends, and many people consider it to be a gauge of the overall economic health of the United States. Many companies, especially smaller companies, lack the resources and tools to invest their extra funds properly. My goal is to give these companies a tool that can give them a general idea of the S&P 500’s upcoming movements. A model that can predict the S&P 500’s long-term movements and week-to-week returns could be very useful to the company in determining entry and exit points for the investment decisions. If this question remains unanswered, it could lead to them making poor investment decisions that could potentially hurt the company’s financial standing. Most importantly, I hope my analysis will provide the companies with conviction in their investment decisions. While many of us have sentiments based on news and other information we gather daily, it is hard to have conviction in your investment decisions if that is all you are basing it off. I hope to provide security and conviction to the company by using historical data to inform what is likely to come on a short and long-term basis, based on decades of history.

Data Acquisition:  I used a combination of financial data, mostly coming from FRED, a database that includes a plethora of historical time series data. I compiled a dataset including market data, macroeconomic data and sentiment analysis data as well.

Methodology: When it comes to financial modeling, capturing the sequential aspect of the data is essential to building a useful model. Financial markets can move very quickly, especially when fear enters the market, like during COVID and the 2008 financial crisis. I wanted to show how important this aspect is when modeling financial data, so I built a standard linear regression model and multiple AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models. Upon finishing my exploratory data analysis I concluded that weekly data I had was not strong enough to actually be predictive. While weekly data is great for capturing the general movements, I believe it is much less prepared to help us understand the rapid movements we see day-to-day at times in financial markets. This inspired me to acquire daily data to try and identify a model with predictive power that I can use to aid small companies in having conviction in their financial decisions.

My linear regression model was built simply to see how a model that did not capture time series data would perform. Next, I built a baseline model called Random Walk. This model assumes that the best prediction for the next week is the result of last week. This is what I used to base the success of my other models on. Finally, I built two different ARIMA models, one that used only the final close price of the S&P500 and the date, and then another that factored in a plethora of other features as well. Finally I built an LSTM, a recurrent neural network this is the most modern way to build a financial model and is known for being able to pick up on non-linear relationships from data that other models can struggle to capture.

Results:
Firstly, my initial thoughts were confirmed with a standard linear regression as it was the lowest performing of my models, but suprisingly it was not too far behind my ARIMA models.
With my ARIMA models, I found that a standard ARIMA was the best at predicting the last 3 years of S&P500 data. I chose this period because it is post-covid and I believe reflects a normal period of financial movement. My SARIMAX model uses moving averages of the S&P500 along with exogenous economic and market data to predict. It performed worse than my standard ARIMA model, but they both performed similarly. Lastly the LSTM really struggled to have any sort of predictive power, LSTM's are known for handling complicated datasets, but I believe my dataset is not robust enough to work well with an LSTM. Overall, the standard ARIMA model was the most effective at predicting the last 3 years of data.
